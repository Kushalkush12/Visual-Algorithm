# Visual Algorithm

This project is a visualization tool for different sorting algorithms, allowing users to see how various sorting techniques work step-by-step. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages Chart.js for dynamic, visual representation of the algorithms.

## Features

- **Choose Algorithm**: Select from four sorting algorithms to visualize:
  - Shell Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
- **Input Custom Arrays**: Enter your own array of numbers to see how each algorithm handles different data.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch each sorting step as the algorithm progresses.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS**: For structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the algorithm logic and interactions.
- **Chart.js**: Used to create dynamic, animated visualizations of the sorting process.
